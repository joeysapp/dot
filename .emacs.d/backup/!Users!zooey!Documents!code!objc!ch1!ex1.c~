/*
  Write a function that returns the average of two floating-point
  numbers. Write a small program ot test your function and log the
  output. Next, put the function in a separate source file but
  "forget" to declare the function in the file that has your main
  routine. What happens? Now add the function declaration to the
  file with your main program and verify that the declaration
  fixes the problem.
