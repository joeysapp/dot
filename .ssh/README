# Pubkey Auth Setup Checklist
If you follow these steps, you can connect to a host and allow a client connection. Assumed you have keys already.
Kittenblob and Foxy are real names, they're two fish I own.

Also I have fun using these emojis keep track. You should try it.

                     ❌

```
   	 = "The Pubkey exchange between host and client" ============================
   ✅	 1. [Host, Kblob] Kittenblob sends us their host pubkey file                    (k:/etc/ssh/kittenblob_host_edd.pub) -> f:~/.ssh/
   ✅	 2. [Client,  us] We send Kittenblob our client pubkey file                     (f:~/.ssh/foxy_client_edd.pub)       -> k:/etc/ssh/
   	
   	
   ✅ = "The Client config " ========================================
    	 3. [Client,  us] We "add" Kittenblob and their details to our config                              (f:~/.ssh/config)
    	     * "Host" is 'kittenblob.local' (cause it's set on their side)
    	     * "HostName" is !!NORMALLY!! kittenblob's internal IP, but it's kittenblob.local
    	     * "User" is zooey
    	     * "IdentityFile" is our (Foxy) private client key file                                        (f:~/.ssh/foxy_client_edd)
         4. [Client,  us] We MUST "add" Kittenblob's pubkey AND the "HostName" internal IP                 (f:~/.ssh/known hosts)
                          To our known hosts file! (which is kittenblob.local)
   	
   	 = "The Host setup and config (TWO STEPS)" ========================================
   ✅	 3. [Host, Kblob] (1st time) Kittenblob makes a "KoolClients" file and adds it to:                 (k:/etc/ssh/sshd_config)
   ✅	 4. [Host, Kblob] Kittenblob adds our (Foxy's) public key to KoolClients                           (k:/etc/ssh/KoolClients)
   ✅	      * That pubkey was sent by us, the client, to Kittenblob the host in step #2.
