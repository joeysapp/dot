Python has been installed as
  /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12

Unversioned and major-versioned symlinks `python`, `python3`, `python-config`, `python3-config`, `pip`, `pip3`, etc. pointing to
`python3.12`, `python3.12-config`, `pip3.12` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3.12 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.12/site-packages

tkinter is no longer included with this formula, but it is available separately:
  brew install python-tk@3.12

If you do not need a specific version of Python, and always want Homebrew's `python3` in your PATH:
  brew install python3
