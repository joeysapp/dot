# 2022-08-15 Backup
backup of home directory because I lost `code/*` and `lit/sheetmusic/` a month ago and I'm never going to be happy

## Notes
* `audio`, `video` and `nikon` have been excluded from this backup
- The expectation is I'll do that later
- My macbook doesn't have enough space

* I freaking hate Windows, flash on a new distro and throw W7/10 onto a trash SSD
