/*
  Write a small program that declares an external variable and also
  calls a function that declares and uses an automatic variable.

  ""(It is not important what the function does for this exercise.)""
  note(joeysapp): eyebrows

  Build the program and then run it in gdb. Set a break point inside
  the function. When you reach the break point, look at the address
  of both the automatic variable and the external variable. 

  You can show the address of a variable by typing:

  p &variableName
